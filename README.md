About Cannabinoid Drug Interaction Review
  Cannabinoid Drug Interaction Review (CANN-DIR) is an online tool designed for medical marijuana patients and caregivers, 
  healthcare professionals, or anyone using cannabis recreationally. CANN-DIR provides information about the interaction between cannabinoids and 
  prescription or non-prescription drugs, helping users to know if cannabinoids will strengthen or weaken the effects of any medications they select.
  The tool is hosted on the Penn State website and has received visitors from 36 different countries in 10 different languages. 
  CANN-DIR has been a useful tool for many people as it can be difficult to find well-sourced information about cannabinoid drug interactions online,
  since they are a newer field of study.
